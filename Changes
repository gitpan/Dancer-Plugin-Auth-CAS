    [ Major ]
    * On failure to authenticate, redirect to 'cas_denied_url' instead of the 'cas_logout_url'
    * Raise hard error when the backend is unable to auth instead of redirecting.

    [ Minor ]
    * Calling auth_cas() with 'cas_user_map', 'cas_logout_path' and 'cas_denied_path' overrides their global value

    [ Patch ]
    * Sensitive content after calling auth_cas() was reachable on error/auth_failure - fixed with harsh halt()
      All users SHOULD upgrade to this version.
